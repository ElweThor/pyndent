# Pyndent - Code Statistics

## The Beauty of Simplicity

Pyndent proves that powerful tools don't need thousands of lines of code.

### Line Count Evolution:

| Version | Lines of Code | Features Added |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Alpha 0.1.0.0 | 40 | Core preprocessing, delimiter handling |
| Beta 0.2.0.4 | 75 | CLI with argparse, auto-naming, error handling |

### Why It Matters:

- **Readable**: Every developer can understand the entire codebase in minutes
- **Maintainable**: Fewer lines = fewer bugs  
- **Unix Philosophy**: Does one thing and does it well
- **Educational**: Perfect for studying how preprocessing works

### Comparison:
- Original alpha: **~0.3%** the size of Python's parser
- Current beta: **~0.6%** the size of Python's parser
- Yet solves a real pain point for developers
